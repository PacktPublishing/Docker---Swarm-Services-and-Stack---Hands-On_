# Docker - Swarm, Services and Stack - Hands-On		
This is the code repository for [Docker - Swarm, Services and Stack - Hands-On](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/docker-swarm-services-and-stack-hands-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Learn advanced concepts in Docker with simple and clearly explained lectures with the help of animated slides. The lectures are followed by demos. We then go through some coding exercises were you will practice Docker commands, and building your own application stack using Docker compose, Docker service, and Docker stacks. You will be developing Docker compose files for various applications stacks and setting up clusters with Docker swarm locally, as well as on public cloud infrastructures . And finally, we will work on an assignment that will give you exposure in deploying a complex application in Docker swarm. In this course we go deeper into the concepts and look at the different options available for Docker for Windows as it is a hot topic and it can be a bit confusing for a beginner. We will then look at advanced topics such as Docker service, what a Docker stack is, what Docker swarm is, what are overlay networks, and how we load balance in Docker. We will look at CI/CD pipeline integration with Docker and Dockerâ€™s support on public cloud platforms.
